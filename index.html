          In 2020, the human race released
          <span class="statistic">34.8 tons</span> of CO2 into the atmosphere.
          That was a down year for us. In 2019 that number was
          <span class="statistic">36.7 tons</span>. We as a species are
          contributing to climate change at an unprecented rate. It's clear this
          trend cannot continue. Our proposed solution? Lorem Ipsum is simply
          dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
          been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
          unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
          specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
          leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
          was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
          containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
          publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem.
